# Pure2D Rendering Library

I made this library to just play around with OpenGL and learn about what goes into rendering and making games.
Lots of bugs still. This is continually being worked on and subject to change as i use this for games that i make.

This is an iteration of my Ruckus-2D Renderer in Rust. :)
